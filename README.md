# OCTADeeplearning

> This repository mainly about deep learning parts which is consists of 3 main parts.</br>
> The data pre-processing part is able to check in this [Github Page](https://github.com/nedleeds/OCTAPreprocessing).</br>
1. **Environment Setting**
> Basically, deeplearning environment is hard to set because it needs to consider lots of things.</br>
> Like, cuda verision, nvidia driver version and the Deep learning framework version(ex, Pytroch, Tensorflow, ...)</br>
> So, it is highly recommended to use docker and I also made my experiment environment by utilizing the docker.</br>
> The fundamental environment for this experiment is like below.
>> - Ubuntu
